                longest one's block = 2

    55          Binary number = 110111
                longest one's block = 3

    39          Binary number = 100111 
             longest one's block = 3      

    69          Binary number = 1000101
                longest one's block = 1

    31         Binary number = 11111
                longest one's block = 5


1) write code to get output as expected

2)  convert decimal number into binary number

3) count the longest 1's block in the binary number
